    interface without the infrastructure headache. Install a Vite plugin,
    connect your GitHub repository, and you're done. Content editors get a clean
    UI, developers keep everything in Git with full version control, and nobody
    has to maintain servers or wrangle complex configurations. One lightweight
    instance handles all your projects.
